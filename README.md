# NBA_statistics_analysis

Analysis of data webscraped from NBA official website, using JupyterLab.
Code was written using Python libraries : Selenium and BeautifulSoup for scraping data from the website, and Pandas with Matplotlib for analysis. 

Important note : if you want to run webscraping by yourself to gather fresh data, you might
need to download chromedriver (which can be done here - https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads), and edit it's path in web_scraping.ipynb file.
Check your version of google chrome to download the right version.
